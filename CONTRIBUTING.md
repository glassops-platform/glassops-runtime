## 🏗️ Community Governance

### The GlassOps Protocol

GlassOps is a **governance-first protocol**. We prioritize architectural health and "One Trigger Per Object" discipline over raw deployment speed.

### Adoption Metrics

Before proposing a major change, consider if it aligns with our target maturity levels:

| Maturity Level | Component           | Who it's for                                  |
| :------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 0**      | **Native Adapter**  | Teams wanting safe, transparent execution.    |
| **Day 30**     | **Scanner Adapter** | Teams ready to enforce architectural hygiene. |
| **Day 90**     | **Hardis Adapter**  | Teams ready for high-velocity automation.     |
